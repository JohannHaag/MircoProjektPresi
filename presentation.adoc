=== Advantages of Fragments

* Fragments are more reusable than views
* Basically a small activity
* Good to use when working on tablet compatible apps

[background-color="blue"]
=== Use cases for fragments

* If you have a feature that can be reused (aka. Progress Bars)

=== Why fragments shouldn't be overused

* Backstack of the fragments in navigation is complicated
* Support library updates may cause new and unexpected ways for fragments to behave.
* Testing an app with a lot of fragments is a pain for bug fixing.

== (Recycler) View

[background-color="blue"]
=== How does it work?

1. Works with the adapter interface
2. Asks adapter how many items there are
3. Asks adapter for a viewHolder and draws the item in the viewHolder

=== Advantages of Recycler view

* Designed to be efficient
* Layout is easily customizable and can be shown in many ways
* Is reusing as much as it can, making the app more efficient
* more efficient sibling of list- and gridview
